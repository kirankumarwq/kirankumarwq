# üí´ About Me:
I am Kiran Kumar A, a BCA graduate with expertise in software development, game testing, and franchise management. Currently, I work at Velocity Venture, specializing in identifying game vulnerabilities, improving security, and collaborating with developers to ensure top-tier gaming experiences.

One of my notable projects is a **Franchise Management System** built using Visual Basic and SQL, which enhanced inventory tracking and reporting for franchise operations. I'm also expanding my knowledge in **AWS** to explore cloud computing's potential in software development.

I work closely with cross-functional teams to implement fixes and improve gameplay, enhancing the overall user experience. My position has deepened my understanding of software development cycles and strengthened my analytical and problem-solving abilities.
